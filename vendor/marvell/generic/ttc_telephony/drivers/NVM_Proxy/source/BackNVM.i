 * GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that

 *
 * The following two macros provide us with a way to use this
 * compiler feature.  Use __predict_true() if you expect the expression
 * to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
 * expression to evaluate to false.
 *
 * A few notes about usage:
 *
 *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
 *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
 *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
 *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
 *
 *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
 *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
 *	  make predictions.
 *
 *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
 *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
 *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
 *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate
 *	  larger code.

 * Macros for manipulating "link sets".  Link sets are arrays of pointers
 * to objects, which are gathered up by the linker.
 *
 * Object format-specific code has provided us with the following macros:
 *
 *	__link_set_add_text(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .text symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_rodata(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .rodata symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_data(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .data symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_bss(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .bss symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_decl(set, ptype)
 *		Provide an extern declaration of the set `set', which
 *		contains an array of the pointer type `ptype'.  This
 *		macro must be used by any code which wishes to reference
 *		the elements of a link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_start(set)
 *		This points to the first slot in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_end(set)
 *		This points to the (non-existent) slot after the last
 *		entry in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_count(set)
 *		Count the number of entries in link set `set'.
 *
 * In addition, we provide the following macros for accessing link sets:
 *
 *	__link_set_foreach(pvar, set)
 *		Iterate over the link set `set'.  Because a link set is
 *		an array of pointers, pvar must be declared as "type **pvar",
 *		and the actual entry accessed as "*pvar".
 *
 *	__link_set_entry(set, idx)
 *		Access the link set entry at index `idx' from set `set'.

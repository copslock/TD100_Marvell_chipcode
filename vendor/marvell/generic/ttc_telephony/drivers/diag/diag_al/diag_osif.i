   File        : osa.h
   Description : This file defines the Intel CCD OS wrapper API and
	      definitions for external application use.

	      The OSA API allows applications to be developed independent of
	      the target microkernel/hardware environment. It provides the
	      facility to add support for multiple independent operating
	      systems from different vendors.

    The OSA API defines a set of interfaces that provide the following
    basic operating system services:

      OS Management     - OSAInitialize(), OSARun()
      Tasks             - OSATaskCreate(), OSATaskDelete(), OSATaskChangePriority(),
			- OSATaskGetPriority(), OSATaskSuspend(), OSATaskResume(),
			- OSATaskSleep(), OSATaskGetCurrentRef()
      Event Flags       - OSAFlagCreate(), OSAFlagDelete(), OSAFlagSet(),
			- OSAFlagWait(), OSAFlagPeek()
      Timers            - OSATimerCreate(), OSATimerDelete(), OSATimerStart(),
			- OSATimerStop(), OSATimerGetStatus()
      Messaging         - OSAMsgQCreate(), OSAMsgQDelete(),
			- OSAMsgQSend(), OSAMsgQRecv(), OSAMsgQPoll()
			- OSAMsgQCreateWithMem()
      Mailboxes         - OSAMailboxQCreate(), OSAMailboxQDelete(),
			- OSAMailboxQSend(), OSAMailboxQRecv(), OSAMailboxQPoll()
      Semaphores        - OSASemaphoreCreate(), OSASemaphoreDelete(),
			- OSASemaphoreAcquire(), OSASemaphoreRelease(),
			- OSASemaphorePoll()
      Mutexes           - OSAMutexCreate(), OSAMutexDelete(),
			- OSAMutexLock(), OSAMutexUnlock(),
      Interrupt Control - OSAIsrCreate(), OSAIsrDelete(),
			- OSAIsrEnable(), OSAIsrDisable(), OSAIsrNotify()
      Real-Time Clock   - OSAGetTicks(), OSAGetClockRate(), OSATick()
			- OSAGetSystemTime()
      Memory            - OSAMemPoolCreate(), OSAMemPoolDelete(),
			- OSAMemPoolAlloc(), OSAMemPoolFree(),
			- OSAMemPoolFixedFree()
      Thread local storage
			- OSATaskSetTls()
			- OSATaskGetTls()
      Symbian Memory    - OSAMemPoolCreateGlobal(), OSAGlobalAlloc(),

 * GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that

 *
 * The following two macros provide us with a way to use this

 * to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
 * expression to evaluate to false.
 *
 * A few notes about usage:
 *
 *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
 *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
 *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
 *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
 *
 *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
 *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
 *	  make predictions.
 *
 *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
 *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
 *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
 *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate

 *	__link_set_add_text(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .text symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_rodata(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .rodata symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_data(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .data symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_bss(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .bss symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_decl(set, ptype)
 *		Provide an extern declaration of the set `set', which
 *		contains an array of the pointer type `ptype'.  This
 *		macro must be used by any code which wishes to reference
 *		the elements of a link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_start(set)
 *		This points to the first slot in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_end(set)
 *		This points to the (non-existent) slot after the last
 *		entry in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_count(set)
 *		Count the number of entries in link set `set'.
 *
 * In addition, we provide the following macros for accessing link sets:
 *
 *	__link_set_foreach(pvar, set)
 *		Iterate over the link set `set'.  Because a link set is
 *		an array of pointers, pvar must be declared as "type **pvar",
 *		and the actual entry accessed as "*pvar".
 *
 *	__link_set_entry(set, idx)
 *		Access the link set entry at index `idx' from set `set'.

  overwriting other allocated objects. This is not a particularly great

  number of bytes allocated via malloc (or realloc, etc) but not yet
  freed. Note that this is the number of bytes allocated, not the
  number requested. It will be larger than the number requested
  because of alignment and bookkeeping overhead. Because it includes
  alignment wastage as being in use, this figure may be greater than
  zero even when no user-level chunks are allocated.

  The reported current and maximum system memory can be inaccurate if
  a program makes other calls to system memory allocation functions

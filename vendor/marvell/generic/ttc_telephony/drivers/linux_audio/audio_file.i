 * GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that

 * The following two macros provide us with a way to use this

 * to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
 * expression to evaluate to false.
 *
 * A few notes about usage:
 *
 *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
 *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
 *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
 *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
 *
 *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
 *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
 *	  make predictions.
 *
 *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
 *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
 *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
 *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate

 *
 *	__link_set_add_text(set, sym)

 *
 *	__link_set_add_rodata(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .rodata symbol `sym' to `set'.

 *
 *	__link_set_add_bss(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .bss symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_decl(set, ptype)
 *		Provide an extern declaration of the set `set', which
 *		contains an array of the pointer type `ptype'.  This
 *		macro must be used by any code which wishes to reference
 *		the elements of a link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_start(set)
 *		This points to the first slot in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_end(set)
 *		This points to the (non-existent) slot after the last
 *		entry in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_count(set)
 *		Count the number of entries in link set `set'.
 *
 * In addition, we provide the following macros for accessing link sets:
 *
 *	__link_set_foreach(pvar, set)
 *		Iterate over the link set `set'.  Because a link set is
 *		an array of pointers, pvar must be declared as "type **pvar",
 *		and the actual entry accessed as "*pvar".
 *
 *	__link_set_entry(set, idx)
 *		Access the link set entry at index `idx' from set `set'.

  number of bytes allocated via malloc (or realloc, etc) but not yet

  number requested. It will be larger than the number requested
  because of alignment and bookkeeping overhead. Because it includes
  alignment wastage as being in use, this figure may be greater than

 * The following always hold:
 *
 *	if (_flags&(__SLBF|__SWR)) == (__SLBF|__SWR),
 *		_lbfsize is -_bf._size, else _lbfsize is 0
 *	if _flags&__SRD, _w is 0
 *	if _flags&__SWR, _r is 0
 *
 * This ensures that the getc and putc macros (or inline functions) never
 * try to write or read from a file that is in `read' or `write' mode.
 * (Moreover, they can, and do, automatically switch from read mode to
 * write mode, and back, on "r+" and "w+" files.)
 *
 * _lbfsize is used only to make the inline line-buffered output stream
 * code as compact as possible.
 *
 * _ub, _up, and _ur are used when ungetc() pushes back more characters
 * than fit in the current _bf, or when ungetc() pushes back a character
 * that does not match the previous one in _bf.  When this happens,
 * _ub._base becomes non-nil (i.e., a stream has ungetc() data iff
 * _ub._base!=NULL) and _up and _ur save the current values of _p and _r.
 *
 * NOTE: if you change this structure, you also need to update the
 * std() initializer in findfp.c.

 * The OBM is responsible to copy image from flash to the DDR.
 * It doesn't know about real image size and always copy the maximum 7MB.
 * The problems:
 *  - long time for copying (about 2 sec),
 *  - all ERR/spy/debug buffers are overwriten.
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 * Put the Image BEGIN and END address onto predefined area - offset_0x1C0 size 0x40
 * Add the the text-signature to recognize are these addresses present in image or not.
 * The signature is following the BEGIN/END and is next ":BEGIN:END:LOAD_TABLE_SIGNATURE"
 * OBM should check signature in flash and if it is present MAY use the size=(END-BEGIN).
 * If signature is invalid the default 7MB is used.
 * The IMAGE_END region added into scatter file

 * GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that

 *
 * The following two macros provide us with a way to use this
 * compiler feature.  Use __predict_true() if you expect the expression
 * to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
 * expression to evaluate to false.
 *
 * A few notes about usage:
 *
 *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
 *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
 *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
 *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
 *
 *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
 *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
 *	  make predictions.
 *
 *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
 *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
 *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
 *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate

 *		contains an array of the pointer type `ptype'.  This
 *		macro must be used by any code which wishes to reference
 *		the elements of a link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_start(set)
 *		This points to the first slot in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_end(set)
 *		This points to the (non-existent) slot after the last
 *		entry in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_count(set)
 *		Count the number of entries in link set `set'.
 *
 * In addition, we provide the following macros for accessing link sets:
 *
 *	__link_set_foreach(pvar, set)
 *		Iterate over the link set `set'.  Because a link set is
 *		an array of pointers, pvar must be declared as "type **pvar",
 *		and the actual entry accessed as "*pvar".
 *
 *	__link_set_entry(set, idx)
 *		Access the link set entry at index `idx' from set `set'.

  You can use this many bytes without worrying about
  overwriting other allocated objects. This is not a particularly great
  programming practice. malloc_usable_size can be more useful in

  Prints on stderr the amount of space obtained from the system (both

  current if malloc_trim and/or munmap got called), and the current
  number of bytes allocated via malloc (or realloc, etc) but not yet
  freed. Note that this is the number of bytes allocated, not the
  number requested. It will be larger than the number requested
  because of alignment and bookkeeping overhead. Because it includes
  alignment wastage as being in use, this figure may be greater than
  zero even when no user-level chunks are allocated.

  The reported current and maximum system memory can be inaccurate if
  a program makes other calls to system memory allocation functions
  (normally sbrk) outside of malloc.

  malloc_stats prints only the most commonly interesting statistics.
  More information can be obtained by calling mallinfo.

 * The OBM is responsible to copy image from flash to the DDR.
 * It doesn't know about real image size and always copy the maximum 7MB.
 * The problems:
 *  - long time for copying (about 2 sec),
 *  - all ERR/spy/debug buffers are overwriten.
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 * Put the Image BEGIN and END address onto predefined area - offset_0x1C0 size 0x40
 * Add the the text-signature to recognize are these addresses present in image or not.
 * The signature is following the BEGIN/END and is next ":BEGIN:END:LOAD_TABLE_SIGNATURE"
 * OBM should check signature in flash and if it is present MAY use the size=(END-BEGIN).
 * If signature is invalid the default 7MB is used.
 * The IMAGE_END region added into scatter file

 * GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that
 * the CPU back-end can hint the processor and also so that
 * code blocks can be reordered such that the predicted path
 * sees a more linear flow, thus improving cache behavior, etc.
 *
 * The following two macros provide us with a way to use this
 * compiler feature.  Use __predict_true() if you expect the expression
 * to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
 * expression to evaluate to false.
 *
 * A few notes about usage:
 *
 *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
 *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
 *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
 *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
 *
 *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
 *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
 *	  make predictions.
 *
 *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
 *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
 *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
 *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate
 *	  larger code.

 * Macros for manipulating "link sets".  Link sets are arrays of pointers
 * to objects, which are gathered up by the linker.
 *
 * Object format-specific code has provided us with the following macros:
 *
 *	__link_set_add_text(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .text symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_rodata(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .rodata symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_data(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .data symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_bss(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .bss symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_decl(set, ptype)
 *		Provide an extern declaration of the set `set', which
 *		contains an array of the pointer type `ptype'.  This
 *		macro must be used by any code which wishes to reference
 *		the elements of a link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_start(set)
 *		This points to the first slot in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_end(set)
 *		This points to the (non-existent) slot after the last
 *		entry in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_count(set)
 *		Count the number of entries in link set `set'.
 *
 * In addition, we provide the following macros for accessing link sets:
 *
 *	__link_set_foreach(pvar, set)
 *		Iterate over the link set `set'.  Because a link set is
 *		an array of pointers, pvar must be declared as "type **pvar",
 *		and the actual entry accessed as "*pvar".
 *
 *	__link_set_entry(set, idx)
 *		Access the link set entry at index `idx' from set `set'.

 *					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112		1003.1-2001
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809		1003.1-2008
 *
 * In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
 * Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
 * that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.

  number of bytes allocated via malloc (or realloc, etc) but not yet

  number requested. It will be larger than the number requested
  because of alignment and bookkeeping overhead. Because it includes
  alignment wastage as being in use, this figure may be greater than
  zero even when no user-level chunks are allocated.

  The reported current and maximum system memory can be inaccurate if
  a program makes other calls to system memory allocation functions

   File        : osa.h
   Description : This file defines the Intel CCD OS wrapper API and
	      definitions for external application use.

	      The OSA API allows applications to be developed independent of
	      the target microkernel/hardware environment. It provides the
	      facility to add support for multiple independent operating
	      systems from different vendors.

    The OSA API defines a set of interfaces that provide the following
    basic operating system services:

      OS Management     - OSAInitialize(), OSARun()
      Tasks             - OSATaskCreate(), OSATaskDelete(), OSATaskChangePriority(),
			- OSATaskGetPriority(), OSATaskSuspend(), OSATaskResume(),
			- OSATaskSleep(), OSATaskGetCurrentRef()
      Event Flags       - OSAFlagCreate(), OSAFlagDelete(), OSAFlagSet(),
			- OSAFlagWait(), OSAFlagPeek()
      Timers            - OSATimerCreate(), OSATimerDelete(), OSATimerStart(),
			- OSATimerStop(), OSATimerGetStatus()
      Messaging         - OSAMsgQCreate(), OSAMsgQDelete(),
			- OSAMsgQSend(), OSAMsgQRecv(), OSAMsgQPoll()
			- OSAMsgQCreateWithMem()
      Mailboxes         - OSAMailboxQCreate(), OSAMailboxQDelete(),
			- OSAMailboxQSend(), OSAMailboxQRecv(), OSAMailboxQPoll()
      Semaphores        - OSASemaphoreCreate(), OSASemaphoreDelete(),
			- OSASemaphoreAcquire(), OSASemaphoreRelease(),
			- OSASemaphorePoll()
      Mutexes           - OSAMutexCreate(), OSAMutexDelete(),
			- OSAMutexLock(), OSAMutexUnlock(),
      Interrupt Control - OSAIsrCreate(), OSAIsrDelete(),
			- OSAIsrEnable(), OSAIsrDisable(), OSAIsrNotify()
      Real-Time Clock   - OSAGetTicks(), OSAGetClockRate(), OSATick()
			- OSAGetSystemTime()
      Memory            - OSAMemPoolCreate(), OSAMemPoolDelete(),
			- OSAMemPoolAlloc(), OSAMemPoolFree(),
			- OSAMemPoolFixedFree()
      Thread local storage
			- OSATaskSetTls()
			- OSATaskGetTls()
      Symbian Memory    - OSAMemPoolCreateGlobal(), OSAGlobalAlloc(),
			- OSAGlobalRead(), OSAGlobalWrite()

 * The problems:
 *  - long time for copying (about 2 sec),
 *  - all ERR/spy/debug buffers are overwriten.
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 * Put the Image BEGIN and END address onto predefined area - offset_0x1C0 size 0x40
 * Add the the text-signature to recognize are these addresses present in image or not.
 * The signature is following the BEGIN/END and is next ":BEGIN:END:LOAD_TABLE_SIGNATURE"
 * OBM should check signature in flash and if it is present MAY use the size=(END-BEGIN).
 * If signature is invalid the default 7MB is used.

// Enables the "Deferred actions" feature


// Enable to run deferred intermediate actions (e.g. LCD printout) not under the thread callback,
// but under the low priority task (public service). This is recommended, because not all actions
// can always be run under the thread callback, which might be an HISR (LCD print impossible).
// Still, using the low priority task service might be not guaranteed under certain error conditions.




// Set OS current thread to a known task thread before running the deferred final action
// This allows the final action code to use OS calls, which are not allowed under HISR
// (relevant external final action).
// NOTE: these OS calls must not be blocking (de-facto), otherwise scheduling might be resumed causing unpredictable results.


// Enables binding of an extended exception handler to catch all exceptions
// Extended handler allows the system to recognize and ignore certain exceptions


// Synchronize the external memory to allow "post mortem" memory content upload: effective for non-reset final actions

 * GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that
 * the CPU back-end can hint the processor and also so that
 * code blocks can be reordered such that the predicted path
 * sees a more linear flow, thus improving cache behavior, etc.
 *
 * The following two macros provide us with a way to use this
 * compiler feature.  Use __predict_true() if you expect the expression
 * to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
 * expression to evaluate to false.
 *
 * A few notes about usage:
 *
 *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
 *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
 *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
 *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
 *
 *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
 *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
 *	  make predictions.
 *
 *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
 *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
 *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
 *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate
 *	  larger code.

 * Macros for manipulating "link sets".  Link sets are arrays of pointers
 * to objects, which are gathered up by the linker.
 *
 * Object format-specific code has provided us with the following macros:
 *
 *	__link_set_add_text(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .text symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_rodata(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .rodata symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_data(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .data symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_add_bss(set, sym)
 *		Add a reference to the .bss symbol `sym' to `set'.
 *
 *	__link_set_decl(set, ptype)
 *		Provide an extern declaration of the set `set', which
 *		contains an array of the pointer type `ptype'.  This
 *		macro must be used by any code which wishes to reference
 *		the elements of a link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_start(set)
 *		This points to the first slot in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_end(set)
 *		This points to the (non-existent) slot after the last
 *		entry in the link set.
 *
 *	__link_set_count(set)
 *		Count the number of entries in link set `set'.
 *
 * In addition, we provide the following macros for accessing link sets:
 *
 *	__link_set_foreach(pvar, set)
 *		Iterate over the link set `set'.  Because a link set is
 *		an array of pointers, pvar must be declared as "type **pvar",
 *		and the actual entry accessed as "*pvar".
 *
 *	__link_set_entry(set, idx)
 *		Access the link set entry at index `idx' from set `set'.

 *					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112		1003.1-2001
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809		1003.1-2008
 *
 * In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
 * Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
 * that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.

  overwriting other allocated objects. This is not a particularly great

  number of bytes allocated via malloc (or realloc, etc) but not yet
  freed. Note that this is the number of bytes allocated, not the
  number requested. It will be larger than the number requested
  because of alignment and bookkeeping overhead. Because it includes
  alignment wastage as being in use, this figure may be greater than
  zero even when no user-level chunks are allocated.

  The reported current and maximum system memory can be inaccurate if
  a program makes other calls to system memory allocation functions
  (normally sbrk) outside of malloc.

  malloc_stats prints only the most commonly interesting statistics.
  More information can be obtained by calling mallinfo.

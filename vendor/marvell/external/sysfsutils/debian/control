Description: interface library to sysfs - development files
 Sysfs is a virtual file system in Linux kernel 2.5+ that provides a
 tree of system devices. libsysfs provides a stable programming
 interface to sysfs and eases querying system devices and their
 attributes.
 .
 This package provides everything that is needed for developing own
 programs using libsysfs: C headers, a static library, documentation
 and example programs.

Package: libsysfs2

Priority: important
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: interface library to sysfs
 Sysfs is a virtual file system in Linux kernel 2.5+ that provides a
 tree of system devices. libsysfs provides a stable programming
 interface to sysfs and eases querying system devices and their
 attributes.
 .
 The package sysfsutils contains frontend programs that use this
 library. Development files and C examples are provided by the package
 libsysfs-dev.

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: sysfs query tool and boot-time setup
 Sysfs is a virtual file system in Linux kernel 2.5+ that provides a
 tree of system devices. This package provides the program 'systool' to query
 it: it can list devices by bus, class, and topology.
 .
 In addition this package ships a configuration file /etc/sysfs.conf which
 allows to conveniently set sysfs attributes at system bootup (in the init
 script /etc/init.d/sysfsutils).
 .
 If you need sysfs queries in own programs, then you may want to use the
 libsysfs library directly (package libsysfs-dev).

Included is a suite to test most of iperf's features. Obviously not
all combinations are done, and because of the nature of the scripts,
some very basic tests are omitted. (For instance, environment variable
options are not tested.)

To run the tests, start the server perl script on one machine, and the
client perl script on another. The iperf command must be in the
current ('.') directory or one level up ('..') to work. To run a test
between bombadil and modi4, use

  modi4> perl server

  bombadil> perl client tests modi4 bombadil

A sample output is provided for comparison. Obviously values will
change but the overall output should be similar.

Any special cases you find that fail and are not included in the test
suite would be helpful to add. Please email them to NLANR/DAST at
<dast@nlanr.net>.
